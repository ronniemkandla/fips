Ferris Fin token will be created to be initially offered to supporters of our financial services which will be largely aimed at low income earners but not exclusively so.
As a company that is enthusiastic about innovation and believes in the blockchain technology Ferris Fin will use this tech to break boundaries that have been long standing and benefiting the few legacy companies.
Our token is aimed to be used for customers who will use it to purchase our financial products/services.
With the difficulties of fiat currency in most of our African countries and/or the transfering funds in the region, the FIPS token could possibly play a role in easing that challenge.
